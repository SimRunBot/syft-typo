# Event Enrichment

Enrich events with client and server-side data.

## Automatic enrichment

Syft library automatically captures the following fields on the client for each event. They are available in the `context` dictionary in the event object.

## Server-side enrichment with Transforms

You can enrich events on the backend with 'server-side' data using transformations. For example, you can
-  Add a `isDiscounted` field to the `Product Viewed` tracking event using data that is only available on the server (the discount status of the Product in the database). 
-  Add extra fields such as the user's title/role to the `identify` event. 

Transforms allow you to build out 'fully complete' events without requiring expensive 'joins' in a post-collection phase.

#### Examples

```ts title="Enrich Product Impression event"
const server = new NextSyftServer({
  destinations,
  // highlight-next-line
  enricher: async (event) => {
    if (event.type === "track" && event.event === "Product Viewed") {
      // highlight-start
      const product = await prisma.products.findUnique({
        where: { id: event.properties.productId },
      });
      // highlight-end
      if (product != null) {
        return {
          ...event,
          properties: {
            ...event.properties,
            // highlight-next-line
            isDiscounted: product.isDiscounted,
          },
        };
      }
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```

```ts title="Validate and Enrich Identify calls"
const server = new NextSyftServer({
  destinations,
  // highlight-next-line
  enricher: async (event) => {
    if (event.type === "identify") {
      // highlight-start
      const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
        where: { id: event.userId as string },
      });
      // highlight-end
      if (user == null) return; // validate identify calls.
      return {
        ...event,
        traits: {
          ...event.traits,
          // highlight-next-line
          role: user.title,
        },
      };
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```
